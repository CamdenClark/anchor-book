Solana, at its core, is a public proof-of-stake blockchain with some really key optimizations that give it high transaction throughput for low cost.

[The Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/overview) explain the core architecture in detail.

For our purposes, developers are able to deploy programs onto this blockchain. Programs can do on-chain computation, and (obeying )

# What is Anchor?

Anchor intends to be the Rails of the Solana ecosystem. Writing programs on Solana without using the Anchor framework is really difficult, there's a ton of boilerplate you have to write.

Anchor wants to minimize the cognitive load on programmers to develop Solana applications. It simplifies a significant amount of the boilerplate previously involved in creating a Solana application.
