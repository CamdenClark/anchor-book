# Prerequisites

You really just need a working knowledge of Javascript and Rust to finish this
guide. If you're a Rust beginner, there will be some unfamiliar syntax
(lifetimes especially), but learning along with the
[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) will probably work
for you if you have a programming background.

### M1 Macs and Windows

There are currently some issues with getting Anchor configured with M1 Macs and
Windows. You should consult the [Anchor Discord](https://discord.gg/sxy4zxBckh)
for help with setting those up.

# Installing

The installation guide
[for Anchor here](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-rust)
will get you everything you need to get through this guide.
