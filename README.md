# Quick intro

Hey, this guide is a work in progress, and I'm a beginner to Solana and Anchor.
Please be gentle with me and take everything in here with a few grains of salt!

The [Anchor Discord](https://discord.gg/sxy4zxBckh) is an enormously helpful
resource, and core devs are often willing to help you out with your questions.
Please use that resource!

I wanted to write down what I was learning as I was learning it, because I
thought it would be helpful to others and myself. If this was helpful to you,
shoot me a [follow or message on twitter](https://twitter.com/camdencodes/).
